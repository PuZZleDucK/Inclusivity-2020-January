## Why F-Droid
<hr />

- The main repository contains only apps that are <span class="fragment highlight-red">free and open-source</span> software
- Apps can be browsed and installed <span class="fragment highlight-red">without registration</span>
- F-Droid links to the <span class="fragment highlight-red">source code</span> of applications it hosts
- The source code of the software <span class="fragment highlight-red">running the F-Droid server</span> is avaliable
- Designed to be resilient against <span class="fragment highlight-red">surveillance, censorship, and unreliable connections</span>
- Supports HTTP proxies and repos hosted on <span class="fragment highlight-red">Tor hidden services</span>
- Client devices can function as <span class="fragment highlight-red">impromptu "app stores"</span> distributing apps to other devices
- GNU Affero <span class="fragment highlight-red">General Public License</span>  version 3 or later (AGPLv3+)

## AntiFeatures
<hr />

F-Droid warns of behaviour that may be undesirable

- Ads – contains advertising
- Tracking – tracks or reports activity, without your permission, or by default
- <span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Non-free Network Services – promotes or depends entirely on a non-Free network service</span>
- Non free Addons – promotes other non-Free apps or plugins
- <span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Non free Dependencies – depends on another non-Free application for its operation</span>
- <span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Upstream Non-free – upstream source is non-free - F-Droid version is patched to fix this</span>
- Non-Free Assets – contains non-free assets
- Known Vulnerability – APK has a known security vulnerability
- Disabled Algorithm – APK was signed using a disabled algorithm

## Potential Drawbacks
<hr />

- <span class="fragment highlight-red">More than 2,300 apps compared to over 1.43 million on other app stores we won't mention</span>
- <span class="fragment highlight-red">Researcher and developer Moxie Marlinspike criticised F-Droid for out-of-date versions</span>
- <span class="fragment highlight-green">The client does not show the number of installs/downloads for each app</span>
- <span class="fragment highlight-green">No formal app review process*</span>
- <span class="fragment highlight-green">Uses its own keys to sign packages, so apps from another source must be reinstalled</span>

## Who Do You Trust?
<hr />

<span class="fragment">
"Applications distributed via the G**gle Play store are signed by the developer of the application, and the Android operating system checks that updates are signed with the same key, preventing others from distributing updates that the developer themselves did not sign"
</span>
<br />

<span class="fragment">
"When F-Droid signs the binaries, the application user needs to trust F-Droid rather than the developer of the application, that no malicious update to an application is distributed"
</span>
